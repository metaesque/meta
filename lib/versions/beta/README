This directory is not (as of 2017-12-31) used directly. It is in the same
shape as ../current, ../stable, and ../versions/v* to showcase what the beta
version uses for lib, schema and src.

See the metastrap.ConfigureVersion() method for details on how the version
is selected. Note that 'meta2' invokes metastrap.ConfigureVersion() before
importing metax.*.

IMPORTANT: As of 2017-12-31, all versions of the code are using

FILE LISTING:

config/
  This should contain a 'metameta' file representing the configuration file used
  for this version. For this 'beta' directory, this is a symlink to a live
  directory that may contain extraneous other files.

lib/
  This should have a 'metax' subdir containing the python 'metax' namespace and
  all sub-modules needed to implement Meta. For this 'beta' directory, this is a
  symlink to a live directory that may contain extraneous other files.

schema/
  This directory contains subdirs 'meta' and 'oopl', with 'schema.meta' files in
  both subdirs describing the Meta(Meta) and Meta(Oopl) schemas. For this 'beta'
  directory, this is a symlink to a live directory that may contain extraneous
  other files.

src/
  This directory contains the Meta source code that implements Meta. For this
  'beta' directory, this is a symlink to a live directory that may contain
  extraneous other files. Source files are:
   - cli.meta2: code for the command line interface
   - fs.meta2: abstract file system
   - logs.meta2: logging
   - parser.meta2: the compiler itself
   - root.meta2: the Object class and associated classes
   - shell.meta2: interactive shell for 'meta2 shell'
   - test.meta2: the Meta test harness
