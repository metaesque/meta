This directory maintains versions of the Meta Library (the collection
of classes written in Meta).  This includes the compiler itself.

FILE LISTING:

README:
  Describes every file in the directory.

beta/
  Provides access to the current implementation of Meta in the format
  expected by current, previous and versions/meta-*.  If the various
  baselang-specific PATH variables include this path, the most cutting-edge
  version of the Meta implementation is used.

  Note that this cutting edge version is inherently fragile.

  Note also that we may move to a model where 'alpha' is the cutting-edge
  version, 'beta' is the previously-alpha version, and 'current' is two
  versions back from cutting-edge.  We have not yet gone there yet though.

metameta2.py:
  A bootstrapping file that must be placed somewhere in PYTHONPATH in order
  for Meta to work.  Will be renamed to metameta.py when we are fully
  migrated from v1 to v2.

?current@
  A symlink to some subdir of versions/.  The current meta library.

?previous@
  A symlink to some subdir of versions/.  The previous meta library.

?versions/
  The list of meta library versions.
