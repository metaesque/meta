# TODO(wmh): Resolve following concerns:
#  - some examples show this file having entries like
#      <subdir>/node_modules
#    while others have entry
#      node_modules
#    I am not clear whether all node_modules directories need to be ignored,
#    or just some of them.

#     |ERROR: in verify_node_modules_ignored:
#     |pnpm install will create nested node_modules, but not all of them are ignored by Bazel.
#     |We recommend that all node_modules folders in the source tree be ignored,
#     |to avoid Bazel printing confusing error messages.
#     |
#     |Either add line(s) to @@//:.bazelignore:
#     |
#     |node_modules
#     |
#     |or disable this check by setting `verify_node_modules_ignored = None` in `npm_translate_lock(name = "npm")`
#     |...
#     # Looks like we definitely should have node_modules in this file!
