On 2023-12-01, I realized that Meta's existing bazel support (which still needs
lots of work) was limited by having a separate WORKSPACE for each language
supported by Meta.

This directory explores a new approach in which there is a single WORKSPACE
across ALL languages. Inspired by the following very useful tutorials:
 - [[https://github.com/sayrer/bazel-lesson-1][C++ & Java code sharing]]
 - [[https://github.com/sayrer/bazel-lesson-2][C++, Go & Rust code sharing]]

Another incredibly useful resource is a curated list of bazel
rules/tooling/resources (which languages are supported, etc. etc.)
 - [[https://github.com/jin/awesome-bazel][Awesome Bazel]]
and the ones supported by Bazel itself are in
 - [[https://github.com/orgs/bazelbuild/repositories?q=&type=all&language=&sort=][all bazelbuild repos]]
 - [[https://github.com/orgs/bazelbuild/repositories?q=rules_&type=all&language=&sort=][bazel build repos starting with rules_*]]
