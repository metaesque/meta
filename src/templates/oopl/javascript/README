FILE LISTING:

BUILD:
  The top-level BUILD file for Meta<Javascript>. As of 2017-12-22, it is empty.

WORKSPACE:
  Specifies all external dependencies needed for Meta<Javascript> to work.
  Of particular importance is io_bazel_rules_closure, from
  https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_closure, which defines the bazel rules
  for compiling javascript using the Google Closure Compiler.
  TODO(wmh): Look into whether rules_nodejs is a better solution.
