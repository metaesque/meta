----------------------------------------------------------------------
FILE LISTING:

BUILD:
  The top-level BUILD file for Meta<C++>. As of 2017-12-22, it is empty.

BUILD.gtest:
  The BUILD file used to compile the gtest suite. Its structure is dictated by
  https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/cpp-use-cases.html#including-external-libraries

CROSSTOOL.Darwin.g++:
  A custom CROSSTOOL file for use on MacOS when one wants to use g++ instead
  of clang (for example because g++ has better C++17 support). The command:
     meta2 -b <baselang> setup
  uses this file to populate the CROSSTOOL file within a bazel repository.
  Note that this file itself does not affect bazel in any way ... one must
  copy the file to
    $(bazel info output_base)/external/local_config_cc/CROSSTOOL
  for it to take effect (or use something like
    https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/wiki/Building-with-a-custom-toolchain
  or
    https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/wiki/Yet-Another-CROSSTOOL-Writing-Tutorial
  to define a new toolchain entirely).

WORKSPACE:
  Specifes all external resources that Meta<C++> needs in order to work.
  One critical dependency is gtest, which can be specified as a dependency of
  a target by adding "@gtest//:main" to "deps" in cc_library.

metastrap/
  Defines the //metastrap:__Meta__ target which is to be included into
  every C++ header file. Ensures that a certain minimum set of commonly
  used symbols are always available.  The intention is to keep this list
  as small as possible ... and maybe to remove it entirely.
  Note that as of 2017-12-22, this isn't even added to C++ targets (but
  probably will be).
