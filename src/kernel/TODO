  The following is problematic because the access for test1() gets
  interpreted as a test method. Need to disallow methods and fields
  that start with 'test' in test classes.

    test
    class TestCase < metax.test.TestCase assocs:
      std assoc os;
    scope:
      field q1 : wmh.ask.Question;
      field test1 : wmh.ask.Test;
    end class TestCase;

 - When parsing a construct with replacer semantics and no explicit id,
   calling 'write' on the resulting construct has two problems:
    1. auto-assigned id's get printed
    2. the implicit nature of the replacer attribute is lost (it becomes
       explicit).

   For example:
      case (i > 10) ::
        j += 3

   becomes:
      case Meta__1__ expr (i > 10) ::
        j += 3
