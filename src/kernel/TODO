 - When parsing a construct with replacer semantics and no explicit id,
   calling 'write' on the resulting construct has two problems:
    1. auto-assigned id's get printed
    2. the implicit nature of the replacer attribute is lost (it becomes
       explicit).

   For example:
      case (i > 10) ::
        j += 3

   becomes:
      case Meta__1__ expr (i > 10) ::
        j += 3
