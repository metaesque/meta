Setting up Meta v2 on a new MacOS 10.13.3 (High Sierra) laptop (2018/04/08)

 - Install bazel:
    % brew install bazel
    - If you encounter the error:
        bazel: Java 1.8 is required to install this formula.
      either install Java yourself (I used Managed Software Center) or use
        brew cask install caskroom/versions/java8
      (untested by me).

 - Establish the directory that Meta will reside within. Below, this dir is
   referred to as $METAROOT. You can define an environment variable to
   represent this directory, but Meta itself does not require one to be set
   (it uses a config file instead of environment variables).

 - Install Meta v2
    - From git
       % cd $(dirname $METAROOT)
       % git clone https://github.com/metaesque/meta.git $(basename $METAROOT)
    - From tar
       - TODO(wmh): Add this

 - Configure config.meta
    % mkdir -p ~/.config
    % cp -r $METAROOT/src/templates/metaxy ~/.config/metaxy
    % cd ~/.config/metaxy
    % $EDITOR config.meta
    - Update the values of the variables to reflect your platform-specific
      values and preferences.
    - To establish what to set the value of 'bazel' to, execute 'which bazel'
    - The value of src_root should be the value of $METAROOT (NOT the string
      "$METAROOT", but rather the path that $METAROOT reprsents).
    - The repository_path is a directory within which all Meta-compiled code
      will be placed. The directory must be writable by whomeever will be
      invoking metac, etc.
    - The cpp_compiler indicates which compiler is desired when compiling C++
    TODO(wmh): Provide an interactive means of creating/modifying config.meta
    via 'metac config', so that the details can be abstracted away.

 - Configure PATH
    - Add $METAROOT/bin to your PATH env var.

 - Compile Meta into python.
    % cd src/
