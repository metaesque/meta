  - cli.meta2 and metax.cli
    - the code in root.meta2 defining metax.root.flags was pulled out
      into cli.meta2 and renamed metax.cli.
  - meta index:
    - implemented command 'index' in 'meta2' interface
    - updated Construct.writeIndex()
    - in meta-mode-template.el, defined metaoopl2-create-index and
      metaoopl2-minor-mode.
    - result: C-@ m ? within a .meta2 file produces an index in a second
      buffer that shows all high-level constructs and allows one to 
      select a line to jump to the desired location in the original buffer.
