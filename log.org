- Advancements on Meta(doc) slides
- Fixed long-standing parsing bug that had implicitly terminated 
  constructs ending in simple blocks improperly consuming empty lines at
  the end.  This no longer happens.

** 2018-10-29
- Contemplated 'metac issue'
  - created stub
  - experimented with ghi (https://github.com/stephencelis/ghi)
    - does not support adding attachements to issues
  - found (but haven't installed/explored) https://github.com/sociomantic-tsunami/git-hub,
    - does appear to support attachments on issues
    - will allow us to attach source code as part of the issue-filing process.
  - explored the github API:
     - docs
       - https://github.com/PyGithub/PyGithub
       - https://developer.github.com/v3/
     - notes:
        % pipi PyGithub
     - very useful:
       - https://gist.github.com/JeffPaine/3145490
         - shows a requests-based call to the github v3 API without bothering
           with PyGithub or anything else.
         - this is optimal, as it means we can implement the same logic in
           all baselangs.
